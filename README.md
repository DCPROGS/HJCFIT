DCProgs
=======

The goal of DCProgs is to provide a collection of tools for scientific research on ion channels. The
package is derived from the [DCPROGS](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dcpr95.html) suite and will
consist of a Python port and wrap of Fortran code with ~30 years usage at University College London.
The rationale is to preserve and cultivate these tools for future research applications.

The documentation for this package can be found [here](http://ucl.github.io/dcprogs/index.html).

Explanations on compiling and installing the package can be found in the
[wiki](https://github.com/UCL/dcprogs/wiki).
