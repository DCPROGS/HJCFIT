###################################
Welcome to DCProgs's documentation!
###################################

The goal of DCProgs is to provide a collection of tools for scientific research on ion channels. The
package is derived from the DCPROGS_ suite and will consist of a Python port and wrap of Fortran
code with ~30 years usage at University College London. The rationale is to preserve and cultivate
these tools for future research applications.

For a description  of the methods involved, see :cite:`colquhoun:1982`, :cite:`hawkes:1992`,
:cite:`colquhoun:1995a`, :cite:`colquhoun:1995b`, :cite:`colquhoun:1996`.
