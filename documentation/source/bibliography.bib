	abstract = {Very simple methods are presented for computing equilibrium distributions of finite-state Markov processes in continuous time and in discrete time, namely Markov chains. These use the {APL} domino function which takes a least-squares approach which is efficient with systems of up to 50 states and probably more. This approach can also be used to solve for mean interval occupancies. It is not suggested that the least-squares solution be implemented in traditional languages like Fortran simply for the purpose of finding equilibrium distributions, for which the state reduction method is simpler. However, if {APL} is available the methods described provide accurate and extremely simple solutions for discrete or continuous-time models. More importantly, the {APL} domino function leads to a powerful and simple computation of mean interval occupancies and, hence, availabilities},

The predicted distributions of the durations of open times, shut times, bursts of openings, etc., are all described, in principle, by mixtures of exponential densities. In practice it is usually found that some of the open times, and/or shut times, are too short to be detected reliably. If a fixed dead-time \${\textbackslash}tau \$ is assumed then it is possible to define, as an approximation to what is actually observed, an `extended opening' or e-opening which starts with an opening of duration at least \${\textbackslash}tau \$ followed by any number of openings and shuttings, all the shut times being shorter than \${\textbackslash}tau \$; the e-opening ends when a shut time longer than \${\textbackslash}tau \$ occurs. A similar definition is used for e-shut times. Several authors have derived approximations to the distribution of durations of e-openings and e-shuttings. In this paper the exact distributions are derived. They are defined piecewise over the intervals \${\textbackslash}tau \$ to 2\${\textbackslash}tau \$, 2\${\textbackslash}tau \$ to 3\${\textbackslash}tau \$, \${\textbackslash}ldots \$, etc., the distribution in each interval being a sum of products of polynomials in t with exponential terms. The number of terms is finite, but increases as intervals get further from t = \${\textbackslash}tau \$. An asymptotic form for large t (for which the exact solution becomes difficult to compute) is given for the two state case. The exact solution is compared with several approximations, some of which are shown to be good enough for use in most practical applications.},

In this paper these methods are generalized so that the observable characteristics of bursts can be calculated directly for any mechanism that has transition probabilities that are independent of time as long as the process is at equilibrium or is maintained in a steady state by an energy supply. General expressions are given for the distributions of the open time, the number of openings per burst, the total open time per burst, the gaps within and between bursts, and so on. With the aid of these general results a single computer program can be written that will provide numerical values for such distributions for any postulated mechanism, given only the transition rates between the various states. The results are illustrated by a numerical example of a mechanism in which two agonist molecules can bind sequentially, and either singly or doubly occupied receptor ion channels may open. The analogous theory is also given for the case where bursts of channel openings are grouped into clusters; many of the results bear a close analogy with those found for simple bursts.},

We obtain some results concerning the poles of the Laplace transform of the probability density function of apparent occupancy times, which correspond to a problem about generalised eigenvalues and eigenvectors. These results provide useful asymptotic approximations to the probability density of occupancy times. A numerical example modelling a calcium-activated potassium channel is given. Some generalisations to the case of random deadtimes complete the paper.},

In practice, some of the open times, and/or shut times, are too short to be detected reliably, making the durations of some of these intervals appear to be longer than they really are. Under certain assumptions about how this happens, the probability densities of these apparent times have previously been obtained. It has been shown that the ability to distinguish between alternative postulated reaction mechanisms can be greatly improved by considering bivariate distributions. In this paper we obtain joint distributions, and hence conditional distributions, of adjacent apparent open and shut times. Numerical examples illustrate what insight these conditional distributions may provide about the underlying mechanism. Bivariate distributions are readily generalized to multivariate distributions which enable the likelihood for an entire single-channel recording to be computed, and hence efficient maximum likelihood estimates for the mechanism's rate constants can be obtained. Numerical examples of such fitting are given.},

	abstract = {Properties of maximum likelihood estimators of rate constants for channel mechanisms are investigated, to see what can and cannot be inferred from experimental results. The implementation of the {HJCFIT} method is described; it maximises the likelihood of an entire sequence of apparent open and shut times, with the rate constants in a specified reaction mechanism as free parameters. The exact method for missed brief events is used. Several methods for testing the quality of the fit are described. The distributions of rate constants, and correlations between them, are investigated by doing sets of 1000 fits to simulated experiments. In a standard nicotinic receptor mechanism, all nine free rate constants can be estimated even from one single channel recording, as long as the two binding sites are independent, even when the number of channels in the patch is not known. The estimates of rate constants that apply to diliganded channels are robust; good estimates can be obtained even with erroneous assumptions (e.g. about the value of a fixed rate constant or the independence of sites). Rate constants that require distinction between the two sites are less robust, and require that an {EC50} be specified, or that records at two concentrations be fitted simultaneously. Despite the complexity of the problem, it appears that there exist two solutions with very similar likelihoods, as in the simplest case. The hazards that result from this, and from the strong positive correlation between estimates of opening and shutting rates, are discussed.},

The calculation of the modified distributions generally involves the numerical inversion of a Laplace transform and is difficult to apply in fitting multistate kinetic schemes to data. Our approach is to introduce "virtual states" into the kinetic scheme, as suggested by Blatz and Magleby (1986. Biophys. J. 49:967-980) to account for missed events. To simplify the assignment of rate constants in multistate schemes we make use of Kienker's (1989. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 236:296-309) theory to first transform schemes to uncoupled form. Our approach provides a good approximation to the exact solution, while allowing the observable dwell-time distributions, and also the second-order probability density functions, to be computed by standard matrix techniques.},
